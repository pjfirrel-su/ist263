    <title>Patrick Firrell - Bio</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    My name is Patrick Firrell, and I am a Recording and Entertainment
    Industries Major interested in digital design as it relates to artists and
    music companies. I currently create social media content for WJPZ Z89 as
    well as my own podcast, DormTalk, utilizing Adobe programs such as Premiere
    Pro, InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator. I am also learning how to design
    and build websites using prototyping software like Adobe XD and Figma as
    well as HTML and CSS. Outside of school and work, I enjoy spending time
    outside and listening to artists like Isaiah Rashad and A Tribe Called
    Quest. I am from Cleveland, Ohio, but my parents are from the UK, and I take
    every chance I get to visit family overseas.
