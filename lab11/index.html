        My name is Patrick Firrell, and I am a Recording and Entertainment
        Industries Major interested in digital design as it relates to artists and
        music companies. I currently create social media content for WJPZ Z89 as
        well as my own podcast, DormTalk, utilizing Adobe programs such as Premiere
        Pro, InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator. I am also learning how to design
        and build websites using prototyping software like Adobe XD and Figma as
        well as HTML and CSS. Outside of school and work, I enjoy spending time
        outside and listening to artists like Isaiah Rashad and A Tribe Called
        Quest. I am from Cleveland, Ohio, but my parents are from the UK, and I take
        every chance I get to visit family overseas.
